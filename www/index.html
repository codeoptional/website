      <h1>Code Optional</h1>
      <p>Three engineering comrades – Andrew Sardone, Kevin Vitale, and Chris Dzombak – talk about development, design, and shipping apps. There's a heavy slant towards Apple tech, balanced with general inquiries around programming and the intricacies/inanities of software.</p>

        <h3>Our first ever guest, designing remotely</h3>
        <p>While Kevin takes the afternoon off for some well-deserved family and petting zoo time, we're joined by our guest Karsten Rowe. Karsten is a UK-based designer, and together with Andrew and Chris he chats about remote work, jumping from graphic to product design, and how one grows and becomes inspired.</p>

        <h3>Unfulfilled Promises</h3>
        <p>Chris has an announcement, followed by a quick discussion about OS X Yosemite and iOS 8. From there, Andrew, Chris, and Kevin go back and forth on Promises and why they're an insufficient abstraction.</p>
